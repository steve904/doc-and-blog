### The State Fair - So Much Fun



Will the State Fair be a thing of the past or will it somehow survive through the murky waters of shut-downs, virus and fear?

Could it be drastically changed so that only a much smaller group can enter the fairgrounds by appointment only?

It's a different playing ground now. Hopefully there will be a way for there to be State Fairs so the public can enjoy them.

### Ohio State Fair Closed to Public

Here's how Ohio is handling the State Fair.

Ohio will only allow events for livestock competitions and educational competitions.

This year's (Ohio) fair will open only to:

*   exhibitors
*   their families and guests
*   Ohio State Fair start on July 19
*   Not sure of the duration

***

### Only Time Will Tell

Watch how each state handles working with the fair. Lots of new methods to open the fairgrounds will be discovered and implemented.

Good luck! Looking forward to seeing the big fairs again.
