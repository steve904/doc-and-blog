Time for some good ole' shish kabob. This afternoon I will strike up the grill, grab a bottle of beer and have some fun. But first we have to go to the store. Gotta make a list of the goodies that we will need.


*   Steak
*   Chicken
*   Peppers (Green & Red)
*   Squash
*   Zucchini
*   Pineapple
*   Mushrooms
*   Marinade
