Time for some good ole' shish kabob. This afternoon I will strike up the grill, grab a bottle of beer and have some fun. But first we have to go to the store. Gotta make a list of the goodies that we will need.

*   Steak
*   Chicken
*   Peppers (Green & Red)
*   Squash
*   Zucchini
*   Pineapple
*   Mushrooms
*   Cherry Tomatoes
*   Marinade

## Red Potatoes With Herbs

I saw something else that looked very good, "Grilled Skewered Red Potatoes". There is some fresh Rosemary beside the house that I can use. Have to see what other dried herbs are in the cabinet. If I find some nice, small red potatoes I will fix these also.

## Grilled Corn

Gotta have some grilled corn to go with this. Wish me luck finding some fresh corn. I may have to buy some frozen ears & grill them.

## *Update*

I decided not to put the pineapple & cherry tomatoes on the skewers. I cooked them in a frying pan with butter and added them to the meal later.

We did not have corn or potatoes. Changed my mind and did not fix these. We had Knorr rice & pasta blend with mushroom flavored sauce. Also...Texas toast.

Everything was very tasty. The buttered pineapple was sooooo good.
