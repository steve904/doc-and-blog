## Senior Portraits in Spring

![](/images/sharegrid-N10auyEVst8-unsplash.jpg)

Got a couple of senior portraits that I need to take care of. One for my son, Joe...an also for a friend of the family...Jessica. Got to nail down the day & time to shoot for Jessica. Also have to get a day for Joe.

## Things they will need:

*   Couple of changes of clothes (maybe)
*   BYOM - Bring your own music
*   Hair cut/styled
*   Makeup for Jessica
*   Comfortable pair of shoes to walk in
*   Shoes for the shoot when we shoot full length
*   Have fun
*   Water/bottle
*   Snacks

## Locations for Shooting

*   Hawaii
*   Rome
*   Tuscany
*   Alps

##### WAKE UP!  Where in Greensboro, NC do you want to shoot?

We will truly have to play this one by ear. Not sure of the restrictions because of the big, bad virus.

Some ideas for locations:

### **For Joe:**

*   Barber Shop - Casey & Chase
*   On top of the school activity bus

*   Look for someone's nice land

*   Lifting weights

*   Wheat field (if possible)

### **For Jessica:**

*   Creek, brook with medium size rocks

*   At Jessica's / Crystal's favorite location

*   Open for suggestions

*   Act like skiing behind Golf Cart (I will explain)

## Camera Gear

*   DSLR camera x 2
*   Extra lens
*   White balance card(s)
*   Color balance charts
*   Phone camera
*   Memory cards - empty cards
*   Flash - hand held
*   White reflective board (with silver)
*   Tripod

## Optional items:

*   Phone app for triggering cameras
*   PocketWizards
*   Photo umbrellas (maybe)
*   White towel (set equipment on)
