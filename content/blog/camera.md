                <strong>Hello Everyone:</strong>
                Stephen Causey here and I've got a couple of senior portraits to take. One for my son, Joe...and also for Crystal's daughter...Jessica. The date, place and time for Jessica's shoot has been established. Come on Joe...you have to catch up!

## Things they will need:

*   Couple of changes of clothes (maybe)
*   BYOM - Bring your own music
*   Hair cut/styled
*   Makeup for Jessica
*   Comfortable pair of shoes to walk in
*   Shoes for the shoot when we shoot full length
*   Have fun
*   Water/bottle
*   Snacks

## Locations for Shooting

We will truly have to play this one by ear. Not sure of the restrictions because of the big, bad virus.

Some ideas for locations:

### **For Joe:**

*   Barber Shop - Casey & Chase
*   On top of the school activity bus
*   Look for someone's nice land
*   Lifting weights
*   Wheat field (if possible)

### **For Jessica:**

*   Creek, brook with medium size rocks
*   At Jessica's / Crystal's favorite location
*   Open for suggestions
*   Act like skiing behind Golf Cart (I will explain)

## Update for Jessica & Location

We are set to go for Jessica's photo shoot. Not going to say where, but it is a very nice place.
Counting on the location not having any restrictions.
