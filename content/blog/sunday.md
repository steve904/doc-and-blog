## Enjoyed the Day

Got a chance to enjoy the wide open spaces today. Little time in the country always feels so good. The wind blowing through the wheat field was more than awesome to look at.

### Kite Flying
I could not keep the kite in the air because the wind was so inconsistent. Tried a few times without a lot of effort. I was having more fun watch my children play hide and seek in the wheat field. They loved it.
