## **Iron and Cloth Barber Shop**

What a great barber shop to go to. The barbers are very friendly and welcoming. They also know how to cut hair very, very well. They are located at 214 West Friendly Avenue, Greensboro, North Carolina. Give yourself a treat and book an appointment with them or just walk in and ask for a hair cut.

## ***Juke Box***

The first thing you will probably notice when you walk into Iron and Cloth is the old Werlitzer juke box. That is quite an amazing sight and the bonus to that is...you can play any song or songs for free.

## **Great Place**

Here is the view as you walk through the door. The juke box is over to the right and the hair products, beard products and t-shirts and hats are next to the juke box. That big fish on the wall, well all I can say about that is "you should have seen the one that got away"!
