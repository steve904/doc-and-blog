Looking at putting in a hardwood floor. The wood is hickory and it is 5" wide and a variety of lengths. (The flooring in the picture is not hickory)

*   Nails for nail gun
*   Air tank
*   Black paper or red rosin paper
*   Square
*   Straight edge
*   Tape measure
*   Broom
*   Dust pan
*   Saw with dust vacuum attached

## Pictures

If I get a chance I will post some pictures of some of the work being done. No promises.
